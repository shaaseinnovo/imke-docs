All identity management in iMKE is done using your openstack accounts. When you log into iMKE you will use the same credentials that you would in optimist.innovo.cloud.

Access management in iMKE is done entirely using iMKE projects. For more information see [our help document for projects](projects).

For accessing the clusters you create using iMKE you can either [download a kubeconfig from the dashboard](../../guides/connectingtoacluster) or create a [Kubernetes service account](secviceAccounts)

If you have a staff member leave and want to make sure that they can no longer access iMKE or the Kubernetes clusters you have created then see our documentation on [removoking access](revokingaccess)
