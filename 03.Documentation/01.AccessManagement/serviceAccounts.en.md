Limited access to a kubernetes cluster can be achieved using kubernetes service
 accounts and the RBAC feature within kubernetes.

To achieve this, we will need to create:
 - kubernetes service account
 - access role
 - role binding for the kubernetes service account to use the access role

All authentication with kubernetes clusters created in IMKE is done using
 bearer tokens. When you create a new kubernetes service account a secret will 
 be created for it in the same namespace, and it will be automatically removed 
 when you delete the kubernetes service account.


## Creating a kubernetes service account
To create a kubernetes service account run the following command and replace 
`my-serviceaccount` with the name you want to use for the kubernetes service 
account:
```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: my-serviceaccount
  namespace: my-namespace
EOF
```

The cluster will then automatically create a new access token with a name like 
'my-serviceaccount-token-#####' where the #s are alphanumeric characters. To 
list the tokens run:
```bash
kubectl get secrets --namespace=my-namespace
```

And then we can print the token we want using the following command and 
replacing $SECRETNAME with the one that has been created for our service 
account:
```bash
kubectl get secret $SECRETNAME -o jsonpath='{.data.token}' --namespace=my-namespace
```

Provide the token that has been printed with the name of the service account to
 a developer or third party to allow them to interact with the cluster.

At this point the service account can authenticate with the kubernetes cluster,
 but is unable to use it do anything. We now need to create a role and a role 
 binding to provide permissions to the service account.

## Creating authorization permissions

Kubernetes has two ways of granting access to service accounts, roles and 
cluster roles. As cluster roles provide access to all namespaces it is 
recommended that you don't use them unless you have to. We will provide 
examples on how to use the namespace restricted roles here.

Roles explicitly whitelist permissions for users (both human and kubernetes
 service accounts) and when a user has multiple roles they can do anything that 
 is granted by any of the roles.

To create a role to allow a user to read information about pods in the 
namespace 'my-namespace' we use the following command:
```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: my-namespace
  name: pod-reader
rules:
- apiGroups: [""] # "" indicates the core API group
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]
EOF
```

To grant the service account we created earlier to use this role, we use the 
following command to create a _role binding_:

```bash
kubectl create rolebinding read-pods \
  --role=pod-reader \
  --serviceaccount=my-namespace:my-serviceaccount \
  --namespace=my-namespace
```

For a full list of resources run 
```bash
kubectl api-resources
```

And for most resources the available verbs are:
 - get
 - list
 - watch
 - create
 - edit
 - update
 - delete
 - exec

The official kubernetes documentation on [controlling access](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/controlling-access/) and [using roles and role bindings in RBAC](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/) provides more details

## Summary

In this guide we learnt how to use the kubernetes cli to:
 - Create a kubernetes service account
 - Retrieve the automatically generated bearer token for a service account
 - Create a new role in kubernetes RBAC
 - Create a binding to allow the kubernetes service account to use that role
